# Laravel Stubs

This package contains clean versions of the stubs shipped with Laravel.  
Most notably:

- Type declarations are used instead of DocBlocks.
- Migrations don't have a `down` method.
- Form requests don't have an `authorize` method.
- Controllers don't extend a base controller.

## Installation

1. Install the package.
   ```console
   $ composer require zepfietje/laravel-stubs --dev
   ```
2. Add the following hook to the scripts in `composer.json` to keep your stubs in sync with updates to this package.
   ```
   "post-update-cmd": [
       "@php artisan stub:publish --force"
   ]
   ```
3. Publish the stubs.
   ```console
   $ php artisan stub:publish
   ```
